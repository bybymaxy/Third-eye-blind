            <h2>ABOUT</h2>
            <p>California alt-rock outfit Third Eye Blind are known for their bright, melodic sound, bringing together a mix of post-grunge and classic pop/rock traditions. The group scored their first hit in 1997 when their debut single "Semi-Charmed Life" cracked the Top Ten, helping push the eponymously titled Third Eye Blind to number 25 on the Billboard 200. The band built upon that success, releasing albums like 1999's Blue and 2003's Out of the Vein, both which continued to earn Alternative chart attention and spawn singles like "Anything," "Never Let You Go," and "Blinded (When I See You)." After taking a break during the mid-2000s, the group returned, hitting number three on the Billboard 200 with 2009's Ursa Major and cracking the Top 20 with 2015's Dopamine. Third Eye Blind have continued to expand their sound, working with Billy Corgan on 2019's Screamer and pairing for a song with Best Coast's Bethany Consentino on 2021's Our Bande Apart.</p>

            <p>Formed in 1993, Third Eye Blind hail from San Francisco, where singer Stephan Jenkins made his name as a solo musician after earning an English degree from the University of California at Berkeley. Jenkins soon decided to piece a band together. After several lineups failed to gel, former Fungo Mungo bassist Arion Salazar joined the group, which Jenkins had named Third Eye Blind (in reference to the metaphysical concept of a mind's eye). At one of the band's early shows, guitarist Kevin Cadogan -- a former student of Joe Satriani who later became involved in the northern California ska and punk scenes -- introduced himself to Jenkins. Cadogan subsequently joined Third Eye Blind in late 1995, bringing along former Counting Crows drummer Brad Hargreaves as well.</p>
